ResizeObserver Polyfill
=============

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]


A polyfill for the Resize Observer API.

Implementation is based on the MutationObserver and uses Mutation Events as a fall back if the first one is not supported, so there will be no polling unless DOM changes. Doesn't modify observed elements. Handles CSS transitions/animations and can possibly observe changes caused by dynamic CSS pseudo-classes, e.g. by `:hover`.

Follows the [spec](http://rawgit.com/WICG/ResizeObserver/master/index.html) and the native implementation. The size is _2.44 KiB_ when minified and gzipped.

[Live demo](http://que-etc.github.io/resize-observer-polyfill) (has style problems in IE10 and lower).
